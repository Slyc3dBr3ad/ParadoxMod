[-Basic Instillation-] 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All you neeed to do to install this mod is locate your mods folder which should be
in the file with the .exe that launches the game, and move every file in the 
"Pokemon" folder of this modpack to the "Pokemon" folder in your mod files! 

I reccomend not using a world you have made prior to installing the latest version
of this mod as long as it in installed, as it can cause some errors, however most
are minor. This goes for any mod that affects Pokemon.

If you wish to replace a different Pokemon with a  please rename the file containing
the data containing the paradox Pokemon information to that of the Pokemon you wish 
to replace (all lowercase)

please note at the time of writing this (pre 0.9) there is no direct way to add 
Pokemon without replacing one. Also some paradox forms do not have modern 
equivalents that are available in wilds. Ex: Amoogus does not currently exist. 
Thus I have replaced Paras and Parasect with Brute Bonnet instead.

If their are any paradox Pokemon you do NOT want to appear, simply delete the file
named after the Pokemon they are replacing. For example, if you don't want 
"Atrocious Fish" appearing, please delete the folders "Magikarp" and "Gyarados"
bellow (this will allow Magikarp and Gyarados to spawn but Atrocious Fish will 
not). A complete list of Paradox Pokemon and what they replace in terms of 
spawning can be found at the bottom.

[-Sprites-]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry my sprite art is awful. If you believe you can do a better job, 
please give it a try! If your sprite is in the proper GSC format and looks 
substantially better than mine, please send it to me and I will consider adding it 
in (with credit, ofc). Or if you simply want to improve on one of my sprites that
is fine too.

Also, for sake of awknowledging it, some of the Pokemon use edited assets from 
their original sprites.
-Great Tusks' OW, Front, and Back sprites are all edited versions Donphan's sprites
-Sandy Shocks's Back sprite is an edited version of Magneton's 
-Lost Carrier's OW sprite is an edited version of Lapras'
-Scream tail's body shape was made by removing all of Jigglypuff's features
-Crystal Terror's OW, Front, and Back sprites are all edited versions Onix's 
 sprites
-Flutter Mane's OW sprite is a (poorly) edited version of Misdreavus'

[-Custom ancient paradox mon info-] 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought it would be fun to add some more ancient paradox Pokemon to this pack,
especially seeing as the list of official paradox Pokemon is... Shallow, to say
the least. I will be adding more later. If you don't like one or all of them, feel
free to remove them :)

A guide for removing paradox Pokemon can be found above in the list.

Crystal Terror is an ancient form of Onix. It has Steelix's jaw and Mega Steelix's
crystal spikes. It also has unique segments similar to those found on Mega Steelix.
The crystal itself is a reference to the "Crystal Onix".

Atrocious Fish is an ancient version of Magikarp. I could not resist the temptation
to add this. It's a tiny bit hard to tell with the crown... fin... things... but 
its body shape is meant to resemble a Salmon rather than... a circle? Or whatever
Magikarp's body shape is. It's (supposed to be) highly aggressive. It has Gyarados'
teeth and its crown thing I mention had been fused with Magikarp's dorsal fin (in
a design sense). Its whiskers are elongates as well. The name "Atrocious Fish" is
a combination of Gyarados' classification as the "Atrocious" Pokemon and Magikarp's
classification as the "Fish" Pokemon.

Lost Carrier is an ancient Lapras. The name and the idea to have a skull on its
back came from a friend of mine who goes by "Quinn". Its meant to be gigantic,
around the size of an island, hence the low pitch cry.

[-TODO:-] 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-(cancel) animations
-Fix cries
-Fix Egg moves
-Redo movesets for original paradox Pokemon once the data is released
-Shiny palletes (ugh)
-Add MORE paradox forms.
-At a certain point I will need to begin balancing this mod so not *everything* has a
 base stat total of 570 because when everyone is super, no-one will be. Not to 
 mention being able to simply pick up a 570 BST Pokemon is comedically overpowered in
 earlygame. Hopefully 0.9 fixes this.

For the purposes of not-entirely-removing-breeding, each Pokemon has the Egg Group
of their modern counterpart. 

Also I opted to replace Volcarona with Koridon instead of Slither Wing for 3 reasons
1: According to Scarlet, Slither Wing is common  while Koridon is extemely rare.
This is also reflected in Scarlet's gameplay.
2: Fighting Koridon in the Ancient Ruins is more climactic than fighting a common
Pokemon.
3: My Slither Wing turned out ugly. It would 200% dissapoint people lol.
